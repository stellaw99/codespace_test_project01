    <h3>Owner - Woofles x Waggy, 2022</h3>
    <h4>A pet accessories brand.</h4>
    <p>Our designs are bespoke and handmade with materials imported and sourced locally in South Africa.<br> I started this brand at the beginning of 2021 while still working in operations for an ecommerce company. <br>I couldn't find products in the marketplace that I really loved with quality and design.</p>
    <p>Since gifting some designs to friends, the brand has started to take off and grow.</p><br>
